# Research / Findings / Questions

- Postman API test-suite is not public
- Missing comma in /content-type-api writeup `PUT ContentType > Payload > "folder": SYSTEM_FOLDER\n`
- Found it hard to determine fields for BlogCollection and nested types, using just the content author views (lack of obvious linkage into subtypes)
- ...click the expanded menu text button, to read the labels...
- Typed GraphQL playground with tabbed auto-complete was a lifesaver
- As is REST API documentation
- It was a bit challenging to find the /dotAdmin login in the site documentation; perhaps because I didn't even know that I needed to find it to figure out what was exposed in the demo site and how to access it
- Consider doing *a* thing with the SDK... maybe page-layout? Already building recursive-descent components for `blogContent`, so `PageView` is more of the same. Just so that I have a sense of how it operates and can speak to it
- Consider using blog tags to query Banner / Promo
